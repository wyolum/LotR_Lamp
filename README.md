# LotR_Lamp
3D printed Lord of the Rings inspired table / desk lamp.
Derived from jerome95's LotR Lamp on Instructables at https://www.instructables.com/Lord-of-the-Rings-Lamp/

I've completely redesigned this from the ground up in FreeCAD

## 3D Printed Parts
- BASE : Lamp base, which houses the micro-controller and a barrel socket adapter. Single color in black. Supports are optional (depending on how good the printer is). There are 4 holes for M3 screws. The 4 screws can act as feet, and if wired to the micro-controller, can be used as 4 touch pads to act as buttons. The buttons can then be used to cycle through different animations, or adjust LED intensity etc.
- BASE COVER : 2 color printing. The cover is black, and the embossed text and tree are white
- PILLAR LEFT and RIGHT : Vertical support pillars in two parts for easier printing and assembly. There is a channel for the wires from micro-controller to LED ring. There are a pair of 1.9 mm holes through which you can insert 1.75 mm filament to staple the top part of the two halves of the vertical pillars. The bottom of the pillars have screw fixing holes. Insert pillars through the Base Cover, and then insert the pillars in the Base. Finally, use 4 wood screws / self tapping screws to nicely hold it all together.
- RING COVER : This is the bottom part of the main ring, and is printed in GOLD / COPPER or similar filament.
- RING : This requires 2 color printing. The inner part of the shell and the text is in white / translucent, and the outer shell is in GOLD / COPPER.

## ELECTRONICS
- LED ring, with 64 addressable LEDs, WS2812 or similar.
- Micro-controller : I used Arduino Nano, but any controller will do the job.
- Example code is in the CODE sub folder
